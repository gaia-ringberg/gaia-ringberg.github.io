## <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> By plane

We recommend flying to Munich Airport (MUC), as this is the nearest international airport to Ringberg. The easiest way to get to Ringberg from MUC is by train. Starting at Munich Airport, take the regional train (S-Bahn) line S1 or S8 to Munich Central Station. From Munich Central Station take the train to Tegernsee Station. The total travel time from MUC to Ringberg Castle is around 2hr. 

## <i class="fa-solid fa-train-tram"></i> By train

The nearest train station to Ringberg is Tegernsee Station. From Tegernsee, you will need to get a taxi to the castle, which is a 15min drive away. 

You can find train travel times by visiting the Deutsche Bahn (German rail) webpage. Train tickets can be bought on the Deutsche Bahn website in advance but we don't recommend the cheaper "saver" tickets as these apply to a specific train – you cannot use them on a different train if you have flight delays.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-taxi"></i> Taxis

Given the number of attendees arriving at the same time, a taxi reservation in advance via email is mandatory (Taxi Jasinski, taxi-jasinski@live.de). Nearer the event start date, we will share a spreadsheet for coordinating taxis between those who may be arriving/leaving at the same time.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> By car

If you decide to rent a car and drive, you can follow the directions on the Ringberg website. Please bear in mind that depending on the snow conditions, you may need snow chains or a four-wheel drive vehicle. Car parking at the castle is free, and does not need to be pre-booked.


## <i class="fa-solid fa-road-barrier"></i> Visas

You may need to apply for a visa to enter Germany. See here for [visa requirements](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/visa-service/visabestimmungen-node). Feel free to contact the organisers if you need a letter of support.

Note: The visa regulations have changed for those travelling from many countries (including the US and UK) to the EU. For more information, see the [ETIAS website](https://travel-europe.europa.eu/en/etias).
