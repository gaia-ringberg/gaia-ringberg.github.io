Exoplanet science will be transformed by the _Gaia_ space telescope with the upcoming fourth data release (DR4). Time-epoch astrometry will allow exoplanets to be identified via the acceleration they impart on their host stars, with potentially many thousands of new planets detectable, as well as more massive brown dwarf and stellar companions. This will transform our understanding of exoplanet demographics, and will open new scientific avenues such as identifying targets that can subsequently be directly imaged, and searching for exoplanets around very young stars (which are difficult to study with the radial velocity or transit methods due to the elevated stellar activity of young host stars), providing the opportunity to study how planet populations change with time and thereby informing our understanding of planet formation. However, there will also be challenges: false-positives such as equal-mass stellar binaries (where the photometrically blended companions must be taken into account) must be carefully considered, and follow-up observations will be required to vet and confirm the wealth of new candidate companions. Given the sheer volume of planet discoveries, community coordination will be key to optimally use follow-up resources for validating and confirming the _Gaia_ exoplanets. 

We invite experts in astrometric exoplanet detection to join us at a conference well in advance of the _Gaia_ DR4 release date, so as to prepare for DR4. Attendees are encouraged to discuss and present work using existing astrometric data, such as studies based on _Hipparcos-Gaia_ accelerations and on the non-single star catalog, as well as preparatory efforts and plans for DR4. The work will be split ~50:50 between talks presenting these efforts, and breakout and discussion sections to encourage collaboration and community building. Together, we will prepare for the exciting range of exoplanet science that will be possible with _Gaia_ DR4.
